====

A modular framework for arbitrary action, **lets** enables tasks of varying complexity to be chained together with a consistent and simple interface.

Each module accepts input and options, executes some functionality, and returns some output.

.. code-block:: bash

   [input] | lets <module> [options]


In this manner, modules can be *chained* together, allowing completely unrelated functionality to work together seamlessly.  Modules can be as simple as base64 encoding or reasonably complex with docker integration.

Let's take a deeper look with :doc:`usage`, or get started with :doc:`install`.
